This project includes code for the calculation of global fire related PM2.5 and its health impacts. The branch "PM2.5_retrieval_model_training_and_prediction" contains code and demo data for the training of PM2.5 
retrieval models and prediction of one day gridded total PM2.5 concentrations in North America; the branch "Acute-health-effects" contains code and demo data for the assessment of acute premature deaths attributable to
Canadian fire related PM2.5 exposure; and the branch "Chronic-health-effects" contains code and demo data for the assessment of chronic premature deaths attributable to Canadian fire realted PM2.5 exposure.
